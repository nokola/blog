<p>And, eventually, Silverlight :)</p>
<p>Here is the "hello world" <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a> login using <span class="searchword0"><a href="http://dotnetopenauth.net">DotNetOpenAuth</a>.</span></p>
<p><span class="searchword0">If you don't know what's OpenID, it's a way to use your existing Google, Yahoo, AOL, Blogger and many more credentials (eventually Live too), to login to an OpenID website.</span></p>
<p><span class="searchword0">The source code allows you to login using Google, Yahoo, MyOpenID, or other provider and returns a state containing a friendly name and database unique ID of the user that is authenticated!</span></p>
<p><span class="searchword0"><a href="http://nokola.com/sources/openidlogin.zip">Download source code</a></span></p>
