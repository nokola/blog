<p>Please take some time to read this appeal completely and eventually donate.</p>
<p>I don't like ads, and there's high possibility that you don't too!</p>
<p>At the same time having an ad-sponsored web site means that ad programs "share" some of people's time (and time is money) spent on my site.</p>
<p>Should I force anyone of the thousands people who view this site to pay for ads? No, I shouldn't and that's one reason to make today's appeal.</p>
<p>The main reason is that I found some very cool music, graphics and so on but they are paid. I want to make 2 more games (space shooter and jump-and-run&nbsp;- you'll see the "drafts" soon), but I "lack the monetary commitment" :)</p>
<p>You can see seemingly random parts of the games and level editors <a href="http://www.nokola.com/starfield/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.nokola.com/BumpMapping/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.nokola.com/Adorners/">here (to be expanded in level editor)</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.nokola.com/LivingNoise/">here</a>. You can also see, and download concept graphics <a href="http://nokola.com/images/planet1.jpg">here</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nikola/archive/2009/07/16/a-taste-of-what-s-to-come-my-new-game-concept-art.aspx">here</a>.</p>
<p>Or, you can see a complete game that topped the community charts on silverlight.net for weeks in 2008 (sans music, since I have to buy it now), here: <a href="http://nokola.com/shock/">http://nokola.com/shock/</a></p>
<p>$2 buys an image, and $15 is the price of a typical soundtrack.</p>
<p>Please <strong><a href="http://nokola.com/shock/donate.aspx">click here to read the full appeal and donate today!</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
