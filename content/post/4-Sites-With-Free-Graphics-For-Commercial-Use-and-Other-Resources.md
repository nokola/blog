<p>Here is the new, categorized links view: <a href="http://www.nokola.com/links/">http://www.nokola.com/links/</a>. It contains a small but soon-to-be-expanded list of graphics, sound, icons, coding, etc resources.<br />I took a first stab at the content, adding few of the sites I use most often.<br /><strong>Please feel free to submit your own links!</strong> And I would love it if you use this for your personal link storage as well! (just add it to your favourites bar)</p>
<p>You can filter by use (Commercial, Free, Paid, etc) and browse by category. The left-hand side is Silverlight (easy to code for all browsers and high performance) and the right-side is HTML in order to allow easier copy-paste and middle-click to open in new tab.</p>
<p>Feedback is strongly appreciated!</p>
<p>I was tired of losing my links every time I reinstall the OS, move to a different pc, etc.<br />If you're like me, you probably have a lot of links or visited a lot of sites but don't have them categorized very well. More importantly, for people who develop projects for themselves or for money, having a quick view of "free for commerial use", "free for personal use", etc resources is very beneficial.</p>
<p>I can feel the pain :) <a href="http://www.nokola.com/links/">http://www.nokola.com/links/</a> is the solution (hopefully)</p>
<p>Please add your links and send me your feedback!</p>
