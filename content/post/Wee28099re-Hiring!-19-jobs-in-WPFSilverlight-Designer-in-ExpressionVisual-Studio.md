<p>The reason I didn’t post for so long: I was waiting for the public announcement of <strong>19 new job openings in the Expression team</strong>!</p>  <p>The jobs include QA (Software Design Engineer in Test), PM (Program Manager) and Dev (Software Design Engineer), Writer and few more. You can apply even if you’re not in the US. </p>  <p>I moved to this team about 2 months ago. I’m currently part of the core/shared graphics team, which is a nice place to be (knock on wood:)) for a person who likes developing samples and working with technologies and devices such as WPF, Silverlight, Windows Phone 7 and web site stuff :)</p>  <p>Expression team includes, amongst other tools Expression Blend, Web, Design. You’ll have opportunity to work at the bleeding edge for both WPF and Silverlight, as well as Expression Web. You may end up working with such software stars like Lutz Roeder (.NET Reflector, anyone?:)</p>  <p>To apply:</p>  <ol>   <li>Open <a title="https://careers.microsoft.com/Search.aspx" href="https://careers.microsoft.com/Search.aspx">https://careers.microsoft.com/Search.aspx</a> OR <a title="http://www.microsoft-careers.com/go/Expression-Jobs/194506/" href="http://www.microsoft-careers.com/go/Expression-Jobs/194506/">http://www.microsoft-careers.com/go/Expression-Jobs/194506/</a></li>    <li>For Product select Expression Studio.
