The Living Noise is an animated “flow” of particles. The particle trajectory is changed by using Perlin Noise (long live Ken Perlin!) I’m so excited. Perlin noise is used pretty much in all special effects – explosions, texture generation, water, clouds, mountains, terrain generation, twinkling stars, halo/weapon effects, etc..
