What makes a good layout system?

GUI Modes:

1. Immediate 
2. Retained

In this post I'll discuss the pros and cons of both types of GUI and propose a new, third kind in an attempt to make a future-ready UI paradigm that combines the pros of both modes, and less of the cons.

Can we have a third kind?
