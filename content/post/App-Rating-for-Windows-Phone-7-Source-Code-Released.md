<p><strong>I’m releasing the App Rating app source code today</strong>, under <strong>MS-RL license</strong> (<a title="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/ms-rl" href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/ms-rl">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/ms-rl</a>). In summary, you can use the App Rating's source for commercial (even directly competitive) projects and are required to provide updates to the source code back to me and the community.</p>  <p>The nice part that you can get from AppRating’s code is the WebApi.cs class, which is optimized for network REST requests, dynamically changing priority of requests, cancelling, etc, and is very lightweight. </p>  <p><strong>Download source code here: </strong><a href="http://nokola.com/sources/apprating.zip"><strong>http://nokola.com/sources/apprating.zip</strong></a></p>  <p>I’m still figuring out the correct license for the rest of my sources. Until then they are all under NNCL (<a href="http://nokola.com/nncl">http://nokola.com/nncl</a>). btw I’m very open to giving it out to people, per the terms of the license. Already approved few requests.</p>  <p>Hope you like it! Please comment!</p>
